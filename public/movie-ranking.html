            <h3>Dying Light 1 and 2</h3>
            <p>"Dying Light" is an open-world first-person survival horror game developed by Techland and released in 2015. Set in a vast and dangerous urban environment devastated by a mysterious virus, the game is centered around the city of Harran, a quarantined zone where infected hosts and the uninfected survivors are trapped together. Players assume the role of Kyle Crane, an undercover operative sent to infiltrate the quarantine zone. The game is notable for its day-night cycle, which drastically changes the gameplay: during the day, players can scavenge for supplies and craft weapons to defend against the infected, while at night, the infected become more aggressive and dangerous, and even more lethal predators emerge.</p>
            <p>Released in 2022, "Dying Light 2 Stay Human" builds upon the foundations of its predecessor with an enhanced focus on narrative and player choices. Set 15 years after the first game, it introduces a new protagonist, Aiden Caldwell, equipped with parkour and combat skills that make him a valuable asset in a crumbling world. The game expands on the first by offering a larger open world filled with new factions and evolving storylines that react to player decisions, affecting the city&#39;s layout and the day-to-day life of its inhabitants.</p>
